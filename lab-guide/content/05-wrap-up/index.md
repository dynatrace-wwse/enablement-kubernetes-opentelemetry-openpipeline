## Wrap Up

### Summary

OpenTelemetry is a powerful observability framework that can be used to monitor the health of Kubernetes clusters and containerized workloads.

Instrumentation: OpenTelemetry provides libraries and agents to instrument your Kubernetes applications. This means adding code to your applications to collect telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.

Data Collection: Once instrumented, OpenTelemetry collects telemetry data from your applications running in the Kubernetes cluster. This data includes information about application performance, resource usage, and error rates.

Exporters: OpenTelemetry supports various exporters to send the collected telemetry data to different backends for analysis. Using the OpenTelemetry Collector is the preferred approach to shipping this data to Dynatrace.

Visualization and Analysis: By exporting telemetry data to Dynatrace, you can visualize and analyze the health of your Kubernetes cluster. For example, you can use DQL to create dashboards that display metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and request latency.

Alerting: With the collected data, you can set up alerts to notify you of any issues in your Kubernetes cluster. For instance, you can configure alerts for high error rates or resource exhaustion.

By using OpenTelemetry in this way, you can gain deep insights into the performance and health of your Kubernetes clusters, helping you to identify and resolve issues more effectively.
