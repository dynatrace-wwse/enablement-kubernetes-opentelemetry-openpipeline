## Prerequisites

During this hands-on training, weâ€™ll learn how to capture logs, traces, and metrics from Kubernetes using OpenTelemetry and ship them to Dynatrace for analysis.  This will demonstrate how to use Dynatrace with OpenTelemetry; without any Dynatrace native components installed on the Kubernetes cluster (Operator, OneAgent, ActiveGate, etc.).

### Training Prerequisites

* Codespaces Cluster Set Up
* Generate Dynatrace Access Token
* Environment Prep
* Deploy OpenTelemetry Operator
